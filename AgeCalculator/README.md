## Code Overview

The JavaScript code (`script.js`) contains functions for age calculation, dark mode toggle, and feedback clearing. Global variables are declared for storing input values and managing the current mode.

## Usage Notes

- Ensure the D.O.B is entered in the correct format (dd-mm-yyyy).
- If the age cannot be calculated (e.g., due to an incorrect format), a message will be displayed.
- The dark mode switch alternates between "style.css" and "style2.css" for light and dark modes, respectively.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please provide feedback using the designated input field. Your feedback is valuable!

**Note:** This readme assumes the presence of HTML files named `index.html`, JavaScript file `script.js`, and CSS files `style.css` and `style2.css` in the same directory. Adjust file names and paths accordingly if they differ.
